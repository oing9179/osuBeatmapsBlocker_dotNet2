osuBeatmapsBlocker_dotNet2
==========================

Block video,SB,background and custom you want.<br/>
This application release without any license, if you want to release or similar, save my name in application, Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
### The application.
Current version: 1.0.1.9<br/>
Special thanks: Shadow Power<br/>
Build with VisualStudio2012, but you can edit with VistualStudio2010, just edit .sln file with text editor(like Notepad++), and edit it you know.<br/>
The main language is Chinese-Simplified, so you can translate it and release with my name.<br/>
### Dear [peppy](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/2)
I just want play happy without cheat, unlike the application osu!AutoPlayer.<br/>
I can not calculate the timeline for Slider because I can not understand .osu file part of Sliders, and the XNA Framework is no longer up-to-date(M$ try to discard it maybe).
But I will save the code until I have found the next way to cheat, only for study and develop program.<br/>
And do not BAN my account please.
